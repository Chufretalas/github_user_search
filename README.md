# Github user search app

This is a react app that searches for a github username and shows some basic information about the user.

I had lots of fun with this one, it was a great way to practice react and ðŸ’™typescriptðŸ’™.

This project was made as a submission for a coding challenge from Digital Innovation One.

## Running the app

After downloading or cloning the files, go to the project directory and run **npm install** to install the dependencies, after that run **npm start**, wait for the app to start, and, if the app didn't open by itself, access **localhost:3000** on your browser.
